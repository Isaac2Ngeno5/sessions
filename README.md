# Learning Php sessions.
this is a three page php code .
The first page i start the session by calling the session start function,
i also set the session variables.
The second page (demo_session2.php) the session start function is still called and then i desplay the session array contiaining the session variables
The third page destroy.php start session then call the session unset function to unset the session array and the session destroy function to end session

## php sessions 2.0
Created a login page which is linked to a database
session variable is set on login using the user id
 i never knew sessions were this easy

 Happy coding
